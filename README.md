    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

## Usage

After installation, you can use the web interface to explore the services offered by CORENSIC. The visitor statistics are automatically recorded and stored in the database, and you can manage or view them through the Django admin panel.

## Technologies

- **Django**: The web framework used for building the landing page and handling visitor statistics.
- **SQLite**: Database to store visitor statistics.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Front-end technologies used to display the landing page content.

## Secret Key Management

To securely manage the Django `SECRET_KEY`, it is stored in a `secret_key.txt` file located in the root directory. The `settings.py` file automatically reads the key from this file.

Make sure to add `secret_key.txt` to your `.gitignore` to prevent it from being exposed in a public repository:

```bash
echo "secret_key.txt" >> .gitignore
```
